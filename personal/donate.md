If you (for some reason) want to donate to me, thank you so much! Here are the links for my payment things if you really want to donate.

# BAT
Yes, I use Brave. It's a nice browser. But anyway, here's how you can donate to me using BAT!

(You need to have Brave installed.)

1. Go to the site. You're already at this step.

2. There should be a BasicAttentionToken icon in your URL bar (Omnibar).

3. Press the BAT icon and "send a tip".

I haven't used Brave for more than over a day so I don't know how it really works, but it should be straight forward.
