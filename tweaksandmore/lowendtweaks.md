# Tweaks you can do to get more performance on a crappy computer
Hi, this is a simple guide I made to help people with bad computers get faster performance.

## part 1: windows 10
Windows 10 is known to be bloated. Everyone knows this. It also doesn't respect your privacy. Nobody that I know irl knows this (because privacy + zoomers dont mix together well)

But, let's get started!

**Step 1: Disable Delivery Optimization** 

Delivery Optimization sounds like a good idea, but it's actually pretty stupid. Especially when you're the only person who uses the internet. What it does is that it makes your PC basically an update server for everyone in your net to use.

This is enabled by default and can and will take a toll on your performance.

**let's disable it**

Go to Settings, press Update and Security, Delivery Optimization and toggle it from **On** to **off**. You wont notice anything but it's there.

**Step 2: Debloat & Privacy**

NOTE: This may remove some apps you use, but there's alternatives to using them anyway. I'm not responsible for any lost data or nuclear explosions.

Take a look at [this Windows 10 Debloater](https://github.com/w4rh4wk/Debloat-Windows-10) and read it's documentation. Space will be freed and you'll have a good life.

**Step 3: Defragging**

NOTE: DONT DO THIS ON AN SSD OR EMMC STORAGE. THIS WILL SHORTEN THE LIFESPAN OF IT. ONLY HDDS CAN DO THIS.

HDDs usually have fragmented files that can slow down the performance of it. This isn't what we want. Here's how we can fix it!

Step 1. Go to the File Explorer

Step 2. right click your Windows 10 drive (you may need to go to "This PC". If you haven't already noticed, dont do this on your SSD. You can do it on your alternate HDD though!)

Step 3. Press Properties, go to Tools and press Optimize.

Step 4. Find the HDD you want to defrag, and press Optimize.

Step 5. Done!

Now you should see faster I/O speed

**Step 4: Uninstall unused apps**

Isn't it obvious? Find apps you never used anyway, and just take em out.

**Step 5: Disk Cleanup**
Disk Cleanup is a builtin disk cleanup tool. I highly recommend everyone do this atleast once. It removes unused files and can remove unused Windows Update files and crash dumps! (I once had 1,5GB of them)
Here's how:

Step 1: Open File Explorer

Step 2: Go to This PC and rightclick your Windows install drive

Step 3: Press Properties and Disk Cleanup

Step 4: if it shows "Downloads" you may want to unselect that.

Step 5: You can press Clean up system files to remove Windows Update files

I'll update this later.
