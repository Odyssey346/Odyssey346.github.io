    <h2>Part 1: Windows 10 Optimalizations</h2>
    <h5>boy if you use windows 10 you're in for a wiiiiiiild ride.</h3>
    <h3>First of all, you want to disable "Delivery Optimalization". This makes your PC basically an update server for your home. <b>Disable it.</b> Go to Settings, Updates and Security, Delivery Optimalization, and then just shut it off. This should grant you a biiiiiiit of FPS.</h3>
    <h3>Once that's done, disable transparency effects in Windows 10. This might grant you a very vey small boost. I despise them, you probably do too, so disable them. Settings, Personalisation, Colors, "Transparency Effects" and just turn that slider to the opposite way. </h3>
    <h3>Step 3 of Part 1: Disable Window Animations | Window animations, while beautiful, take some resources. To disable them, type in "System" in Search (or navigate through with Control Panel) and then "Advanced System Settings". You'll bee shown "Performance" or "Animations" or whatever. I don't really use that option, I've moved past my crappy Acer. (I wrote this on it!) and disable all effects. It'll look ugly, you should do some tweaks atleast. </h3>
