# Enable Acer trackpad support for GNU/Linux
**If you have a laptop from Acer running GNU/Linux, you've probably encountered this.**

"My trackpad isn't working no matter what I do!"

**To answer that, it's something Acer has enabled by default in their UEFI bios. If you disable it, your trackpad will work.**

Do the following:
  
  1. Boot your machine into the Setup Utility (usually F2 is the button that does this)
  2. Navigate to Main
  3. Find "Trackpad"
  4. Change it from Advanced to Basic
  5. Reboot to your GNU/Linux distro of choice and enjoy your trackpad.
